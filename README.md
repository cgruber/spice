# Spice - a metadata system for software projects

<!-- Insert status/version icons here -->

*“He who controls the spice, controls the universe”* - Frank Herbert

# Overview

Spice seeks to provide consistent build metadata in a way that can be somewhat neutral to tools (gradle, maven, bazel),
but can provide high-performance, thin representation of their build graphs for a variety of use-cases, including
(but not limited to):
  - build system migration,
  - multi-build-system scenarios,
  - consistency across a large codebase,
  - declarative build metadata
  - fast graph-aware tooling divorced from specific build systems

More detail can be found in the [Design Doc](DESIGN.md)
